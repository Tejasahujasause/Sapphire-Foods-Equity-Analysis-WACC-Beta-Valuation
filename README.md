**Sapphire Foods India Ltd — Integrated Financial Analysis & Valuation**
**Project Overview**

This project presents a full-stack financial analysis of Sapphire Foods India Ltd, integrating market behavior, risk estimation, capital structure analysis, valuation modeling, and strategic investment review.
The analysis is conducted strictly in one Excel workbook, following academic and professional finance standards, with complete transparency of assumptions, formulas, and intermediate calculations.
The project combines market data, accounting data, and corporate disclosures to evaluate whether Sapphire Foods is fairly valued, how its risk profile evolves over time, and how its capital allocation decisions compare to peers.

**Excel File Structure (Single Workbook)**


**TASK I — Stock Price Volatility & News Attribution**

Objective: Identify large abnormal price movements (>5% excess return over index) and classify volatility drivers.

**Methodology:**
Computed daily stock returns and index-adjusted abnormal returns
Identified large intra-day excess movements (>5%)
Classified volatility into:
Market-driven
News-driven (earnings, expansion, regulatory, macro)
Speculative (no identifiable public trigger)

**Deep-Dive Analysis:**
Tracked pre-event (−5 days) and post-event (+5 days) price behavior
Evaluated momentum persistence vs mean reversion
Assessed whether speculative spikes resulted in sustained re-pricing

**Key Insight:**
Speculative volatility showed short-lived price continuation, whereas fundamental news events led to sustained repricing, indicating semi-strong form market efficiency.

**TASK II — Beta Estimation & Stability Analysis**

**Objective: Measure systematic risk across time horizons and frequencies.**

**Approach:**

Calculated beta using:
Daily data
Weekly data
Monthly data

**Time windows:**
Rolling 1-year betas (5 observations)
Rolling 2.5-year betas (2 observations)

**Analysis Conducted:**
Compared beta stability across sampling frequencies
Identified periods of risk regime change
Linked beta spikes to volatility clusters from Task I

**Key Finding:**
Beta is not stable across frequencies, with higher sensitivity during expansion and restructuring phases, aligning with periods of elevated abnormal returns.

**TASK III — Cost of Capital & Equity Valuation**

**Objective: Estimate firm-level WACC and intrinsic equity value.**

**WACC Estimation**

Computed using:
Book Value Weights
Market Value Weights
Target Capital Structure

**Inputs:**

Cost of Equity (CAPM)
Cost of Debt (after tax)
5-year rolling averages
Corporate tax adjustments
Growth & Valuation

**Growth estimated using:**
Revenue CAGR
Net Income trend
Valuation Model:
Constant Growth FCFE Model

**Derived:**
Intrinsic Market Capitalization
Implied Share Price
Conclusion:
The valuation indicates the stock is [Undervalued / Overvalued] relative to market price*, primarily driven by expectations around margin expansion and capital efficiency.
